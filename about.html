       <h1>What is this about</h1>
         <p> This is the end result of the Superhi course Plan, Design and Code your first website. I decided to do a digital version of something I always wanted to do as a physical object but as a digital design. 
         In a sense, I'm doing exactly what I would be doing if I made a physical fanzine. Picking images, writing or copying text, overlapping and creating a composition of pieces together that makes sense, telling a story. </p>
   
   <p>But this is not a fanzine, I can't replace or reproduce the physical object, the texture of the paper, the experience of unfolding and folding. 
   
   I choose to say that a fanzine is made out of paper and not as a digital object, even if the process as a creator is almost the same.</p>
   
   <p>My intention here is to have a space to think about the importance of the physical object and the relationship with the author. 
   
   With the instructions, I propose a collaboration space between myself and whoever is on the other side. Download, print, follow the instructions (or not, is your choice), edit, create and recreate your own fanzine, share it with others.
